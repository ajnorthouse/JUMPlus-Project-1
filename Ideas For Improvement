--------------- v2.0 - Improvements ---------------
== Structures:
- For-Loops
  - change them to do-while loops with incrementer kept inside it.
  - so the incrementer can be kept track inside of it, allowing you to retry passwords, usernames, and the like on inputs in case they're invalid.
 
 
== Connection:
- JDBC connection, instead of just being in memory.


== User Interface:
- Ask user for dark-mode or light-mode on initial boot!


== Testing:
- User Model Testing
  - Don't test getters and setters UNLESS they have custom logic in them

- Bank Controller Testing
  - Remove unused methods
  - Create tests for the new methods

- Bank Application Testing
  - Only testing for the input methods should be required

- Colored Output Testing
  - You can maybe test the outputs?

- User View Testing
  - You can test what it returns / prints
 
 
 
 
--------------- v2.1 - Optional Features ---------------

- Add a implementation that allows the user to chose between file saving and jdbc connection.
