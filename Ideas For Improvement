------- VERSION 1 fixes --------
 
== Registering:
- use a scanner.nextLine() instead of scanner.next() for the name input
  - you should also use this for anything involving spaces


== REGEX:
- implement password REGEX
- implement contact number REGEX


== Transfer funds:
- Don't allow them to transfer funds to themselves.
  - though, would this be necessary if it removes and then adds it back in?
 
 
 
 
------- VERSION 2 Implementations --------
 
== Structures:
- For-Loops
  - change them to do-while loops with incrementer kept inside it.
  - so the incrementer can be kept track inside of it, allowing you to retry passwords, usernames, and the like on inputs in case they're invalid.
 
== Connection:
- JDBC connection, instead of just being in memory.

== User Interface:
- Ask user for dark-mode or light-mode on initial boot!

== Testing:
- User Model Testing
  - Don't test getters and setters UNLESS they have custom logic in them

- Bank Controller Testing
  - Remove unused methods
  - Create tests for the new methods

- Bank Application Testing
  - Only testing for the input methods should be required

- Colored Output Testing
  - You can maybe test the outputs?

- User View Testing
  - You can test what it returns / prints
 
 
 
 
------- VERSION 2.1 Addition --------
 
== Structures:
- Add a implementation that allows the user to chose between file saving and jdbc connection.
